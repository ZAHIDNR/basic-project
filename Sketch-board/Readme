I was working on my grid project, but the color change feature wasn’t working. Even after selecting a new color, the grid kept using random colors.

After checking my code, I realized The issue was that I was using if (color) inside the mouseover event, but color was not dynamically updating when the user selected a new color. The changeColor function updated colorChanged, but since color was just a parameter passed once to createGrid(), it didn’t reflect the new value.

By replacing color with colorChanged, the event handler directly accessed the updated color, making the color change dynamic.
