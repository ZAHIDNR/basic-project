I was working on my grid project, but the color change feature wasn’t working. Even after selecting a new color, the grid kept using random colors.

After checking my code, I realized The issue was that I was using if (color) inside the mouseover event, but color was not dynamically updating when the user selected a new color. The changeColor function updated colorChanged, but since color was just a parameter passed once to createGrid(), it didn’t reflect the new value.

By replacing color with colorChanged, the event handler directly accessed the updated color, making the color change dynamic.

Some features are not available yet, but we plan to add them in future updates. 
For example, the download feature is not currently included, but we are working on it and will introduce it later.
