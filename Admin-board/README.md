I’ve created an **admin dashboard project** as part of The Odin Project, and I wanted to share a bit about the experience.

One of the main issues I faced was with **Chart.js**, which I used to create graphs. However, the charts weren’t responsive. I had added my own CSS to handle layout and resizing, but **Chart.js was injecting inline styles**, which have higher **specificity** than styles in a CSS file. As a result, my graphs weren’t shrinking properly, and the layout got messed up — the grid shifted and content started overflowing. It was frustrating to deal with.

Thankfully, after some trial and error, I was able to solve the problem. It took some effort, but I’m pretty proud of the result — especially because I built the whole project **from scratch**. Even though I’ve only been learning for about three months, this project really pushed me, and I learned a lot.

If you’ve read this far, just know that I really appreciate it. I hope everything good comes your way — and thank you again!

If you have any suggestions or feedback on the project, I’d love to hear it. I'm always looking to improve.
